# Assignment5
Design an HTML page to display the following output:

a) <PRE>

The PRE command uses a preset format from a device used

to create a file, especially in cases of a word

processor created document. It is an easy way to

convert text documents to Web documents. Check your

code by inserting <PRE> tag in your document.

b) <LIST>

Lists can be either order or unordered. Unordered lists

use symbols for display, ordered lists use numbers.

Example: (Ordered List)

i. Circle (default)

ii. Square

iii. Moon

Example: (UnOrdered List)

i. One

ii. Two

iii. Three

Additional Information:

Please note the following:

􀂉 The title of the page must be FormatterTags.

􀂉 The file name must be FormatterTags.html.
